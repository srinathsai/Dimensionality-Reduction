# Dimensionality-Reduction

## Introduction :-
Before knowing the importance of dimensionality reduction, let's explore the problems with dimensionality reduction. 
### Problems with Dimensionality Reduction :-
  - It can mean high computational cost to perform learning.</br>
  - It often leads to over-fitting when learning a model, which means that the model will perform well on the training data but poorly on test data.</br>
  - Data are rarely randomly distributed in high-dimensions and are highly correlated, often with spurious correlations.</br>
  - The distances between a nearest and farthest data point can become equidistant in high dimensions, that can hamper the accuracy of some distance-based analysis tools.</br>
