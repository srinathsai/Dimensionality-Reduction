# Dimensionality-Reduction

## Introduction :-
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is a process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of the original data.</br>

Before knowing the importance of dimensionality reduction, let's explore the problems with dimensionality reduction. 
### Problems with Dimensionality Reduction :-
  - It can mean high computational cost to perform learning.</br>
  - It often leads to over-fitting when learning a model, which means that the model will perform well on the training data but poorly on test data.</br>
  - Data are rarely randomly distributed in high-dimensions and are highly correlated, often with spurious correlations.</br>
  - The distances between a nearest and farthest data point can become equidistant in high dimensions, that can hamper the accuracy of some distance-based analysis tools.</br>

These limitations really create a big hardships in determining the accuracy of any model's prediction or classification. </br>
### Therefore importance of dimensionality reduction comes into play because :-
  - Dimensionality reduction helps with these problems, while trying to preserve most of the relevant information in the data needed to learn accurate, predictive models. </br>
  - There are often too many factors on the basis of which the final prediction is done. These factors are basically variables called features.</br>
  - The higher the number of features, the harder it gets to visualize the training set and then work on it. </br>
  - Sometimes, most of these features are correlated, and hence redundant. This is where dimensionality reduction algorithms come into play. </br>
  - It reduces the time and storage space required.</br>
  - It helps Remove multi-collinearity which improves the interpretation of the parameters of the machine learning model. </br>
  - It becomes easier to visualize the data when reduced to very low dimensions such as 2D or 3D. </br>
